# FiskAI Content & SEO Dominance Strategy

## 1. Introduction: The Vision

This document outlines a comprehensive, long-term strategy for FiskAI to become the undisputed #1 digital resource for anyone starting or running a business in Croatia. The vision is to build a "knowledge moat" so deep and authoritative that FiskAI is the top recommendation from both traditional search engines (Google) and AI-powered search (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

## 2. The Core Principle: The Virtuous Cycle

The strategy for dominating organic search and AI search is deeply interconnected. To become the primary source for AI models, you must first become the most authoritative and trustworthy source on the public web.

This creates a powerful, self-reinforcing loop:

```
        ┌──────────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────┐
        │  High-Value, Granular    │──────►│  Top Google Rankings  │
        │   Content, Tools, Q&A    │      │  for Long-Tail Keys   │
        └────────────┬─────────────┘      └──────────┬──────────┘
                     │                               │
                     │                               │
        ┌────────────┴─────────────┐      ┌─────────▼──────────┐
        │  Cited by AI Models as   │◄──────│   More Authority,   │
        │    the "Ground Truth"    │      │ Backlinks & Mentions│
        └──────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Pillar I: SEO Dominance (The Digital Treasury)

The goal is to answer every possible question a Croatian entrepreneur might have. Your `COMPLETE_MODULE_MATRIX.md` is the blueprint for this. The strategy is to "atomize" this expert knowledge into hundreds of highly specific, discoverable pages.

### Strategy 1.1: Atomize Core Knowledge

Instead of relying only on long-form guides, break them down into their smallest logical pieces.

- **Action Step:** For every single row and concept in your master `MATRIX.md` document, create a dedicated, SEO-friendly page or article.
- **Examples:**
  - A page titled: `"What are the 2025 contribution rates for a Paušalni Obrt?"`
  - A page titled: `"What is the maximum revenue for a j.d.o.o.?"`
  - A page titled: `"Tax differences between an Obrt and a d.o.o."`
- **Benefit:** This creates hundreds of "long-tail" pages that perfectly match specific user searches, dramatically increasing your surface area for ranking on Google.

### Strategy 1.2: Build the Definitive Glossary (`/rjecnik`)

Become the dictionary for Croatian business.

- **Action Step:** Create an A-Z glossary for every Croatian business acronym, term, and form: OIB, JOPPD, DOH, URA, IRA, Prirez, PDV-S, etc.
- **Benefit:** You will rank #1 for every `"što je..."` ("what is...") query. This builds immense authority and provides endless opportunities for internal linking back to your main guides and tools.

### Strategy 1.3: Create the "How-To" Hub (`/kako-da`)

Capture users who are actively trying to complete a specific, critical task.

- **Action Step:** Create step-by-step, visual guides for every common bureaucratic process.
- **Examples:**
  - `"How to fill out the PO-SD form (with examples and a downloadable PDF)."`
  - `"How to register your business online via e-Građani: A 10-step visual guide."`
  - `"How to issue your first fiscalized invoice: A complete walkthrough."`
- **Benefit:** This content is highly valuable, shareable, and positions FiskAI as a practical assistant, not just a source of information.

## 4. Pillar II: AI Search Dominance (The LLM's Professor)

LLMs learn from the public web. By executing Pillar I, you are already building the foundation. The following actions will optimize your content to be easily understood and cited by AI.

### Strategy 2.1: Master Structured Data

You are already using the `Article` JSON-LD schema, which is excellent. Double down on this.

- **Action Step:** Wrap all content types in their specific schemas.
  - Use the `HowTo` schema for your step-by-step guides.
  - Use the `FAQPage` schema for your FAQ sections.
  - Use the `VideoObject` schema if you embed video tutorials.
- **Benefit:** Structured data is unambiguous. It makes it trivially easy for an LLM to understand that your page contains a definitive answer to a specific question, making it more likely to be used as a source.

### Strategy 2.2: The Q&A Format (The "AI-Specific" Twist)

This is the most direct way to "speak" to an AI model.

- **Action Step:** On **every single page**—every guide, tool, and glossary entry—add a small "Pitanje i Odgovor" (Q&A) section at the bottom. The question should be a natural language query, and the answer should be concise and self-contained.
- **Example (on your PDV Calculator page):**
  > **P:** Koji je PDV prag u Hrvatskoj za 2025. godinu? (What is the VAT threshold in Croatia for 2025?)
  > **O:** PDV prag u Hrvatskoj za 2025. godinu iznosi 60.000 EUR. Poduzetnici čiji godišnji prihod prijeđe ovaj iznos obvezni su ući u sustav PDV-a.
- **Benefit:** You are "pre-packaging" knowledge in the exact format that LLMs use to construct their answers. When Gemini or ChatGPT needs to answer that question, it will find your perfectly formatted, authoritative answer and is highly likely to cite FiskAI as the source.

## 5. Pillar III: Audience Building (The News Engine)

To keep users coming back, you need dynamic, up-to-date content.

### Strategy: The "Weekly Tax Briefing" (Tjedni Porezni Pregled)

"Daily" news is high effort. A curated weekly digest is more sustainable and often more valuable.

- **Action Step:** Create a "Tax Briefing" section on your site. Every Friday, publish a short, easy-to-understand summary of the week's most important news for small businesses.
- **Official Sources to Monitor:**
  1.  **Porezna Uprava (Tax Administration):** `porezna-uprava.hr`
  2.  **Ministarstvo Financija (Ministry of Finance):** `mfin.hr`
  3.  **Narodne Novine (Official Gazette):** `nn.hr`
- **Benefit:** This positions you as a timely, trusted advisor. Most importantly, this digest becomes the core content for a **high-value email newsletter**, which will be your most powerful tool for building a loyal, recurring audience.

## 6. Pillar IV: Measuring Success

You will know the strategy is working by tracking these key metrics:

- **SEO Metrics:**
  - **Organic Traffic Growth:** The primary indicator of success.
  - **Keyword Rankings:** Track your rank for hundreds of long-tail keywords (e.g., via Ahrefs or SEMrush). You should see a steady increase in top-3 rankings.
  - **Number of Indexed Pages:** This should grow into the hundreds or thousands as you atomize content.
- **Audience Metrics:**
  - **Newsletter Subscribers:** The growth rate of your email list.
  - **Returning Visitors:** The percentage of users who come back to your site.
- **Brand Metrics:**
  - **Branded Search Volume:** The number of people searching directly for "FiskAI".
  - **Backlinks Earned:** The number of other websites linking to your guides and tools.

## 7. Conclusion

By executing this vision, you will not just be creating a website with good SEO. You will be building a comprehensive, interconnected **Digital Treasury of Croatian business knowledge**. This creates a powerful competitive advantage that is incredibly difficult for others to replicate, establishing FiskAI as the authority that both human users and AI models trust and recommend above all others.

# Addendum: Execution Playbook (Templates + Trust + Schema)

This section is designed to be copy/paste ready into tasks, checklists, and implementation tickets.

## A. Trust / E‑E‑A‑T Moat (Non‑Negotiables)

**Goal:** In a tax/legal niche, Google and AI models heavily favor sources that look _maintained_, _reviewed_, and _officially grounded_.

**Add to every Guide/Glossary/How‑To page:**

- **“Last updated” + Change log:** show the date and 2–5 bullet “what changed”.
- **Sources block:** 2–6 links to official sources (Porezna, Narodne Novine, Ministarstva, HOK/HUP where applicable).
- **Reviewer line:** “Reviewed by” (e.g., certified accountant / tax advisor) + short credentials.
- **Scope disclaimer:** “Informational; for edge cases consult a professional.”
- **Canonical ownership:** one canonical URL per concept; redirect duplicates.

**Editorial policy pages to publish once:**

- `/metodologija` (how calculations are made, what assumptions)
- `/urednicka-politika` (review cadence, corrections policy)
- `/izvori` (official sources list + update triggers)

## B. Page Templates (So “Atomization” Doesn’t Become Thin Content)

### B1) Atomized Answer Page Template (Long‑tail)

**URL:** `/pitanja/<slug>` or within a cluster like `/paušalni/pdv-prag`

**Above the fold (“Featured Snippet” block):**

1. **One‑sentence answer** (plain language, includes the number/threshold/date).
2. **Two supporting sentences** (context + who it applies to).
3. **Next best action CTA** (Wizard / relevant tool / register).

**Body structure:**

- **Why it matters** (3 bullets)
- **Example with numbers** (one worked example)
- **Common mistakes** (3 bullets)
- **FAQ** (3–6 Q&As)
- **Internal links:** 5–10 links to hub + adjacent pages

### B2) Glossary Entry Template (`/rjecnik/<pojam>`)

- **Definition (1–2 sentences)**
- **Where it appears** (forms/contexts)
- **When you must care** (trigger conditions)
- **Related terms** (5 internal links)
- **FAQ** (2–4)

### B3) How‑To Template (`/kako-da/<task>`)

- **Prerequisites checklist**
- **Step‑by‑step** (numbered, with screenshots/video if possible)
- **Troubleshooting** (top 5 errors)
- **Downloadables** (PDF checklist, example form)
- **FAQ + Sources**

### B4) Tool Page Template (Calculator / Wizard / Generator)

- **What this tool answers (1 sentence)**
- **Inputs + assumptions** (clearly stated)
- **Outputs** (show “how to interpret” + “what to do next”)
- **FAQ + Sources**
- **Embed “Q&A”**: 3–5 direct questions the tool answers

## C. Topic Cluster Architecture (Hubs + Satellites)

**Rule:** Every satellite page must link to its hub, and the hub must link back to its top satellites.

Recommended hubs:

- `/paušalni-obrt` (hub) + satellites (doprinosi, prag PDV, PO‑SD, fiskalizacija, troškovi)
- `/obrt-na-dohodak` (hub) + satellites (knjigovodstvo, odbici, PDV, doprinosi)
- `/doo` (hub) + satellites (direktor, dobit, isplate, PDV)
- `/freelancer` (hub) + satellites (inozemstvo, ugovori, porezi)
- `/pdv` (hub) + satellites (prag, registracija, EU usluge, obrasci)
- `/rokovi` (hub) + monthly deadline pages

Internal linking rules:

- Each page has **“Related”** (5–8) + **“Next step”** (Wizard/Tool).
- Use consistent anchor text; avoid “click here”.

## D. Structured Data Checklist (Schema)

**Every page:**

- `BreadcrumbList`
- `WebSite` + `Organization` (site‑wide)

**Guides / long articles:**

- `Article` (already used) + `SpeakableSpecification` (optional, for the “Quick answer” block)

**How‑To pages:**

- `HowTo` (+ `HowToStep`, `HowToTool`, `HowToSupply` where relevant)

**FAQs:**

- `FAQPage` with `Question`/`Answer` (generate from your FAQ component)

**Tools / calculators:**

- `SoftwareApplication` or `WebApplication`
- Pricing pages: `Product` + `Offer` (monthly/annual)

**Videos (when added):**

- `VideoObject` + `clip` timestamps if you have chapters

## E. AI‑Citation Optimization (LLM‑Ready Content)

- Add a standardized **“Quick answer”** block near the top (2–4 sentences).
- Add a standardized **“Pitanje i Odgovor”** section at the bottom (3–7 Q&As).
- Use consistent units and formatting (EUR, dates, thresholds).
- Prefer small tables for thresholds/rates; AIs parse them well.
- Publish an `llms.txt` pointing to your canonical hubs/glossary/tools (optional but useful).

## F. Maintenance & QA (So Content Stays #1)

- **Update triggers:** yearly thresholds, Narodne Novine changes, Porezna announcements.
- **Review cadence:** quarterly review for hubs, yearly review for satellites, immediate review on law changes.
- **Quality gate before publish:** (1) has sources, (2) has quick answer, (3) has FAQ, (4) has internal links, (5) has schema, (6) has lastUpdated.
