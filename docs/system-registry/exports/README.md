# System Registry Exports

This directory contains exports generated by the registry export tool.

## Generating Exports

```bash
# Local
npx tsx src/lib/system-registry/scripts/export.ts --format csv

# Via GitHub Actions
# Go to Actions → Registry Export → Run workflow
```

## Formats

- **csv**: Ownership matrix for spreadsheet analysis
- **regulatory-pack**: ZIP file for compliance audits
- **drift-history**: JSONL for trend analysis

## Retention

Exports are git-committed manually when needed for audit trail.
On-demand exports via CI are retained for 90 days.
Drift history is append-only and committed by the scheduled history workflow.
